# Bozo
Javascript based 2D Game Engine hosted with Github Pages.

## Overview
This project is still in its early stages. I only work on this from time to time, so the progression of this project is going to be slow.

## Features
todo

## Technologies
* Uses [File System Access API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_Access_API) for instantiating a directory which contains the output game source files.

## Current goals
* Put necessary source files into generated directory.
* Implement ecs into editor.

## Future Plans
* create some games (browser based) using this project.
* make it installable as a web application.
